# 👋 Hi, I'm John Vincent Barrozo!

### 🎓 About Me
I'm a 2nd year **BS Computer Science** student at the **University of the Philippines Baguio**.  
I'm currently building my foundations in programming, algorithms, and data-driven thinking.

### 🧠 What I Know
- **C Language** — my first programming language  
- **Python & Java** — currently learning and practicing  
- **Data Analytics** — taking an introductory course to explore data science fundamentals  

### 👨‍💻 What I'm Working On
- Exploring small projects to improve my coding skills
- Learning GitHub early to build good habits and track my progress

### 🌱 What I'm Looking For
I'm open to beginner-friendly projects, collaborations, and anything that can help me sharpen my problem-solving skills and confidence in development.

### ⚡ Fun Fact
I'm a shiftee from **BS Mathematics → BS Computer Science**.  
I thought I was escaping math... but CS said *“nope.”*  
Still, I'm enjoying CS way more because I finally see the real-world applications.
